For this repository, Python and Django path are set up for an Ubuntu 14.04 user named as **user**. Anyone can run existing project and/or create a new project under this repository after successful clone. But, before cloning you have to **create a user** named as **user** with **admin permission** to avoid installation hazards for above requirement. Otherwise, you feel hazards for Python and Django installation and then you take only django project from this repository for testing purpose.
